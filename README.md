# ML Predictive Wizard
This project is an interactive and user-friendly machine learning prediction tool designed to assist users in making accurate predictions based on their dataset. The application allows users to upload their own datasets, enabling the creation and deployment of machine learning models for predictive analysis.

# Features

### 1. Dataset Upload
Users can upload their datasets (e.g., "Disease Prediction," "Iris," etc.) in csv format.

### 2. Model Building
Users specify the independent (features) and dependent (target) columns within the dataset.
The application then builds a machine learning model based on the user-provided data.

### 3. Prediction Generation
Once the model is trained, users can make predictions on the specific dependent variable using the provided input data.

# Supported Datasets
The application supports various datasets suitable for classification tasks, including but not limited to:

1. Disease Prediction Dataset
2. Iris Dataset
3. Titanic Dataset
4. Wine Quality Dataset
5. And more... 

# Technologies Used
1. Python
2. Machine Learning Libraries (e.g., Scikit-learn,Numpy, Pandas)
3. Web Framework (Django)
4. HTML, CSS, JavaScript
